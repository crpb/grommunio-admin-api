grommunio-admin connect \[em] Connect to remote CLI
.SH Synopsis
.PP
\f[B]grommunio-admin connect\f[R] [\f[I]-c COMMAND\f[R]]
[\f[I]--no-verify\f[R]] [\f[I]--redirect-fs\f[R] [\f[I]--auto-save
(local|remote|discard|print)\f[R]]] [\f[I]-v\f[R]] [\f[I]HOST\f[R]
[\f[I]USER\f[R] [\f[I]PASSWORD\f[R]]]]
.SH Description
.PP
Connect to a remote server to invoke CLI commands on.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Requires a running admin API with active remote CLI and a user with
\f[V]SystemAdminPermission\f[R].
.PP
Note that the remote CLI currently uses a REST interface which does not
provide a standard input, rendering commands that rely on user
interaction useless.
.SH Options
.TP
\f[V]HOST\f[R]
Host to connect to, in the format
\f[I]protocol\f[R]://\f[I]hostname\f[R]:\f[I]port\f[R], where protocol
is either http or https.
If omitted, the protocol is auto-detected, with https taking precedence
over http.
If no port is specified, the default ports 8080 (http) and 8443 (https)
are used.
\f[I]hostname\f[R] can either be a resolvable host name, an IPv4 address
or an IPv6 address in brackets.
The default hostname is \f[I]localhost\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]PASSWORD\f[R]
Password to use for authentication.
Default is to prompt.
.TP
\f[V]USER\f[R]
User to use for authentication.
Default is \f[I]admin\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]--auto-save ACTION\f[R]
Choose automatic action for received files when filesystem redirection
is enabled.
Possible actions are:
.RS
.PP
\f[I]discard\f[R] - discard any received file
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[I]local\f[R] - save at local path
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[I]print\f[R] - print file contents to stdout and discard
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[I]remote\f[R] - save at path reported from remote server
.RE
.TP
\f[V]-c\f[R], \f[V]--command\f[R]
Execute command on remote server and exit instead of starting an
interactive shell.
.TP
\f[V]--no-verify\f[R]
Continue with https even if the TLS certificate presented by the server
is invalid.
Required if the server uses a self-signed certificate that is not
installed on the system.
Use with caution.
.TP
\f[V]-p\f[R], \f[V]--password\f[R]
Prompt for password even when connecting to localhost.
.TP
\f[V]--redirect-fs\f[R]
Redirect CLI initiated file operations to local filesystem.
See section \f[I]Filesystem Emulation\f[R] for details.
.TP
\f[V]-v\f[R], \f[V]--verbose\f[R]
Print more detailed information about the connection process.
.SH Filesystem Emulation
.PP
When the \f[I]--redirect-fs\f[R] option is given, CLI initiated file
operations are performed in an emulated filesystem and written files are
sent back to the client.
.PP
Note that this does only apply to files which are opened by CLI
operations, while module-level operations (e.g.\ loading of
configurations) are unaffected.
.PP
Files received from the remote server can then be viewed or saved
locally.
